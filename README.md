# SQLBolt Exercises

I worked on various MySQL queries which helped me understand how relational databases work. This repository contains PDF of the executed queries from [SQLBolt](http://sqlbolt.com/), covering fundamental to advanced-level database operations.

## Overview

The exercises on SQLBolt guided me through various topics, including:
- Basic SQL syntax
- Filtering results using `WHERE` clause
- Using `JOIN` to combine tables
- Aggregating data with functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`
- Grouping results using `GROUP BY` and filtering grouped data with `HAVING`
- Inserting, updating, and deleting records
- Advanced concepts like subqueries, indexing, and transactions

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- Each pdf slide is named according to the corresponding lesson.
- The pdf illustrate both the SQL queries I executed and the results produced.

## Lessons Learned

Working through the SQLBolt exercises allowed me to:
1. Gain a deeper understanding of relational database concepts.
2. Write efficient and optimized SQL queries.
3. Perform complex data retrieval and manipulation tasks.
4. Understand the importance of indexing and query optimization.
